I created the Step Trend classification technique to categorize market **direction**. It is based on a derivative of [Donchian Channels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donchian_channel). I use different values for the highest high vs the lowest low. Signals are based on the last step. The direction is up if the last step was up. The direction is down if the last step was down.
